Shown in the picture is the shiny new 10T weight restriction sign installed at Bromley taxpayers' expense to the east of the bridge. There are no weight restriction signs to the north of the bridge (Greenwich) or to the west of the bridge (Lewisham).

Lewisham assert that the bridge now has a 40T weight limit (presumably believing it has been strengthened) and they gleaned this information from Bromley.

Either Bromley has squandered taxpayers' money on the new sign or Lewisham has made a mistake in removing the 10T limit signs.

At no point since I reported this problem 12 days ago have all of the bins been put back onto the residents property / removed from the pavement.
