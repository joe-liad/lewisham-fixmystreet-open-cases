To further confuse matters, there is a second bridge over the River Quaggy this time on Mottingham Lane, again on the boundary of Bromley and Greenwich, but with Greenwich the highway authority. Could it be that this bridge has the 10T limit.

Whatever the answer, this matter needs investigating as a matter of urgency, and the investigation should include liaising with Lewisham and Greenwich highway authorities to get to the bottom of this matter and ensuring that all three highway authorities display the correct signage for the bridge.",Road Traffic Signs

Large orange gas bottle fly tipped onto pavement by resident of either 38 or 38a holdenby road,"Large orange gas bottle fly tipped onto pavement by resident of either 38 or 38a holdenby road: A Large orange Gas Bottle has been put out onto pavement by residents of either number 38 or 38A Holdenby Road:

I reported the situation of residents at 38 and 38A leaving their Bins outside their properties obstructing the pavement for many days at a time and Fly tipping unwanted household items on the pavement outside their homes on the 3rd of May but evidently Lewisham Council have still not contacted them to instruct them to stop doing that as it is still happening:

Today - Monday 17th May some of the Bins have been left out [again] on the pavement since last Wednesday`s Bin emptying day.

They regularly leave either all 4 Bins or 2 of them out obstructing the pavement for many days - often more than a week.

I originally posted a report about that because it was obstructing the pavement when I was going past with my child`s buggy especially when other people were trying to walk past the bins - I sometimes have had to go out into the road to wait for people to pass the bins before proceeding - not desirable with a child in a buggy.

At no point since I reported this problem 12 days ago have all of the bins been put back onto the residents property / removed from the pavement.

Now one of the residents has put a large orange coloured Gas bottle outside on the pavement.

I wonder if there is still Gas in the bottle ?

I feel that this could be very dangerous if for example an inquisitive child tried to turn it on not realising that they should not touch it.

It is NOT good enough for the Council to just categorise this report / complaint as something like: `Passed to the Highways Department` - I cannot remember the exact term used for my previous report.",open,-0.038557,Fly-Tipping,Fly-Tipping,[object Object],2021-05-17T19:27:30+01:00,3,desktop,"A Large orange Gas Bottle has been put out onto pavement by residents of either number 38 or 38A Holdenby Road:

"Problem not fixed: Stones in Calmont Road: Despite numerous responses today that the problem is fixed, it isn't.

Whilst most stones are not on the Calmont Road carriageway, they are on the Hillbrow Road carriageway. As the photos show, road markings indicating a bump in the road are partially covered and the direct route used by pedestrians crossing Hillbrow is covered by stones. These are particularly difficult to walk on for those in 'equality' categories eg the elderly, infirm and carers with prams. Further more, because the stones are in very close proximity to Calmont Road (and generally are all over it), this is dangerous for cyclists and in addition, car wheels can flick the stones into the air dangerously.",Street Cleaning,"Despite numerous responses today that the problem is fixed, it isn't.
